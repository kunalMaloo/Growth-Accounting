# Project README

This README provides instructions on how to download the dataset, upload it to Google Colab, and run the code in the Jupyter notebook.

## Step 1: Download the Dataset

1. Download the dataset file `Active Users (4) (1) (1) (1).csv`  and `Growth_Accounting (1).ipynb` from the provided source.
2. Save the file to your local machine.

## Step 2: Open Google Colab

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Sign in with your Google account if you are not already signed in.

## Step 3: Upload the Dataset and the .ipynb file to Google Colab

1. In Google Colab, click on the `File` menu and select `Upload notebook`.
2. Upload the Jupyter notebook file `Growth_Accounting (1).ipynb`.

## Step 4: Create a Folder and Save the Dataset in Google Colab

1. In Google Colab, open a new code cell.
2. Select and upload the dataset file `Active Users (4) (1) (1) (1).csv` from your local machine.

## Step 5: Run the Code in the Notebook

1. Ensure that the code in the notebook references the dataset path correctly. The dataset should now be in the `content` folder, so use the following path in your notebook:

    ```python
    dataset_path = '/Active Users (4) (1) (1) (1).csv'
    ```

2. Run the cells in the notebook to perform your data analysis or growth accounting tasks.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you should be able to download the dataset, upload it to Google Colab, organize it in a specific folder, and run the provided notebook code successfully. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the Google Colab documentation or seek help from the project contributors.
